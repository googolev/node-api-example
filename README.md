# node-api-example
There are some basic logic for node-api app.

In repo you can find frontend-part and backend-part of app.

Backend stack: 
  - express
  - mongodb
  - body-parser
  - cors
  
To run backend just type: <code>npm run app</code>
<hr>


Frontend stack:
  - vue
  - axios
  - eslint
To run frontend just type: <code>npm run serve</code>
Front is very simple, without Vuex store. It's like Postman in web-page format
